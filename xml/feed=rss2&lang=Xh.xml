<h2 class="entry-title">Mathematics or dreams, which is more real? <em>Izibalo okanye amaphupha, yeyiphi eyona iyinyani?</em></h2>
<div class="post-content">
<p>Mathematics can sometimes seem dream-like, at least on first encounter. Later on, one gets<br />
used to a new mathematical object, and it seems everyday. I remember how strange the idea of<br />
a group was to me, how mysteriously it grew from three almost trivial axioms to a forest<br />
of subgroups and quotient groups and equivalence classes and so on. Of the few dreams I<br />
now recall, there was one with a huge hall full of people, perhaps a giant cave, and I was descending a long,<br />
rickety staircase — or was I sliding down a cable? — feeling myself among a heretofore<br />
completely unsuspected part of humanity, who perhaps nobody from above ground had ever seen.<br />
Groups were a bit like that, and saying that a square had a symmetery group did not<br />
make them appear any less unexpected.</p>&#8230;</div>]]></description>
