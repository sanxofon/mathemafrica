		<description><![CDATA[<p>I’m not sure how, but it’s been a month since my last post. It feels like it was just the other day that I was working on its first draft… Since my first blog dealt with the language of Mathematics, I thought I might continue the language theme for now as it is something that really interests me.</p>
<p>Let me start by asking you this: How often do you take being a First Language English speaker for granted? (Has this thought ever even crossed your mind?) Have you ever traveled to a foreign country and needed to communicate and found it difficult? Were you frustrated by this? What happens when you don’t have a very good grasp of a particular Language, would you want to speak it? Or read it? Or perhaps worse still, write it?</p>
<p>Well, I think this is the challenge that a number of learners face and they are often left feeling frustrated and misunderstood in their classrooms, particularly in South Africa, where we have 11 official languages.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>So this is my first post and any real “nerd” will know why I named my post “Hello World”. Many years ago, I dabbled in a little bit of computer programming and the first program you ever write, as kind of a rite of passage, is to make the screen say “Hello World”. Needless to say, it wasn’t always easy, but nothing worthwhile in life ever is. At times, I really did want to pull my hair out though, with things like syntax errors. Firstly, I had to work out what a syntax error was… Basically, in layman’s terms, it’s like making a grammar or punctuation error in an essay. Secondly, I needed to find this syntax error (or errors), most of the time it was a missing semi-colon, in my thirty or forty lines of code. Did I mention that the technology didn’t even give you a hint as to where you might begin to look for it.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

<p>1. CANP4, the fourth event in the Capacity and Network Project organized by the International Commission of Mathematical Instruction (ICMI) and supported by the International Council of Science (ICSU) held its first meeting in East Africa in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on September 1-12 204, with more than 80 participants from Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda, This event led to the creation of a new &#8216;East Africa Mathematics Education and Research Network&#8217;. The founding President is Dr Alphonse Uworwabayeho (Rwanda) and the founding Secretary is Dr. Angelina Bijura (Tanzania).</p>
<p>2. Call for Candidates for Ibni Prize 2014.<br />
The Prize &#8220;Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh&#8221; has been created in memory of our colleague and to continue its commitment to Mathematics in Africa. The prize is awarded annually to a young mathematician from Central Africa or West Africa. Applications are evaluated by a scientific committee set up by CIMPA.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

<p>Watch this TED Video by Ron Eglash, an ethno-mathematician, who studies the way math and cultures intersect. He has shown that many aspects of African design — in architecture, art, even hair braiding — are based on perfect fractal patterns.</p>

		<title>A foray into a new number system &#8211; an introduction to imaginary numbers</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This is the introduction which I give to my first year mathematics class when they see imaginary numbers for the first time. I thought I&#8217;d type it up here as it&#8217;s received good reactions the two times that I&#8217;ve introduced it in this format.<b> </b>Note that this probably isn&#8217;t the canonical way to introduce complex numbers, but then most of my lectures don&#8217;t necessarily take the normal route&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Complex Numbers, a philosophical detour</b></p>
<p>Before we get on to talking about imaginary numbers and complex numbers, let&#8217;s try and break down our preconceptions about numbers in general.</p>
<p>We look at the world around us and see many things which we categorise. We see a computer, a piece of paper, we see other people, we see our hands. These are labels that we use to categorise the world, but these objects seem very physical and very real. We rarely question their existence, though if one wants to take the Cartesian view, we should also question the reality we are in.&#8230;</p>]]></description>
