		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jonathan, thank you for pointing that out, I have made the necessary corrections. The formula gives an upper approximation of possible states because it includes board conditions that will never occur in a real game; for example, you can never have a board state in which all pebbles are in a single pit. As for the simulation; it has been a matter of interest in artificial intelligence and algorithm analysis since the game was developed. In algorithm analysis, developers often choose between going for aggressive win strategies, or loss minimization strategies. I have tried to incorporate the best of both worlds (to some extent) in my version, so it should prove to be a worthy adversary. Enjoy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Many thanks Tapiwa!! 

I have to say that the number of possible positions seems surprisingly small given this is a combinatoric expression. I would expect to find a factorial in there somewhere, rather than it simply to go linearly with most of the variables. I hope to be able to play this on a Windows computer when I track one down!]]></description>
