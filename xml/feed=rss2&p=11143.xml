		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] This is the fourth year that I&#8217;ve played the 2/3rds numbers game with my first year maths class. I&#8217;m always interested to see how, knowing previous results will affect this year&#8217;s results. Of course I am sure that a great deal depends on exactly how I explain the game, and so I imagine that this is the largest confounding factor in this &#8216;study&#8217;. If you don&#8217;t know about the 2/3rds numbers game, take a look at the post here. [&#8230;]]]></description>
