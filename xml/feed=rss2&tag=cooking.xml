		<description><![CDATA[<p>This post is not going to be very maths-heavy but will include some concepts from the area of graph theory which we will use in an unusual setting.</p>
<p>Today we&#8217;re going to get into the virtual kitchen and get our virtual taste buds a-buzzing&#8230;.Well, actually we&#8217;re going to get our computers to do the hard work of finding out some tasty recipes and we&#8217;re going to use a few different techniques to do this. The workhorse is going to be the <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/">Mathematica</a> programming language, but a lot of what we will do will be doable in any programming language, though perhaps it will be slightly more cumbersome than this.</p>
<p>The starting point of our culinary adventure will be a piece of text, taken from a website of flavour pairings <a href="http://nouveauraw.com/raw-recipe-templates-and-development/flavor-prfiles-that-pair-well-in-recipes/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We see here that we have a piece of text which we can copy and paste into our Mathematica file.&#8230;</p>]]></description>
