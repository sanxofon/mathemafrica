<div style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="" src="http://i1.wp.com/press.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/covers/9780691174167.png?resize=336%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="http://i1.wp.com/press.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/covers/9780691174167.png?resize=336%2C480&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">From Princeton University Press</p></div>
<p>This book straddles a tricky middle ground, given that it introduces topics from scratch and goes into some very specific details of them in a relatively few pages, before jumping onto the next. On starting to read it, I was skeptical of how this could possible work, but by the end of it I believe that I saw the real utility of a book like this. The audience is quite specific, but for them it will be a gem.</p>
<p>The book covers a huge range of ideas related to chance, from the underlying mathematics of probability, to the psychology of decision making, the physics of chaos and quantum mechanics, the problems inherent in induction and inference and much more besides.</p>
<p>The book is taken from a long-running course at Stanford which the authors taught for a number of years, and they have tried to condense down the most important aspects of it to a relatively light book.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>NB. I was sent <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11041.html">this book</a> as a review copy. In addition, I lent this book to a student studying statistics, as I thought that it would be more interesting for them to let me know how much they get out of it. This is the review by Singalakha Menziwa, one of our extremely bright first year students.</p>
<div style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="" src="http://i1.wp.com/press.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/covers/9780691149547.png?resize=336%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="http://i1.wp.com/press.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/covers/9780691149547.png?resize=336%2C480&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">From Princeton University Press</p></div>
<p>All the tools you need to understand chance, the insight of statistics at base, and more complex levels. Statistics is not just about substituting into the correct formulae but requires understanding of what the numbers mean. Counting rules and Statistical inference were two of the topics I struggled with, especially the logic behind statistical inference, but this book provided great insight and explanations regarding these topics with a step by step procedure and gave enough interesting exercises. Miller’s goal when writing the book was to introduce students to the material through lots of accurately done, in depth worked examples and some fascinating coding for those who want to get more practical, to have a lot of conversations about not just why equations and theorems are true, but why they have the form they do.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Statisticians have long been separated into two camps as to how they philosophically interpret their trade. These schools of thought are usually called <em>Frequentists</em> and <em>Bayesians</em>.</p>
<p>Frequentists believe that a probability, <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5Cin%5B0%7E+1%5D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="p&#92;in[0~ 1] " title="p&#92;in[0~ 1] " class="latex" />,   associated with a <em>specific</em> possible outcome of an observable occurrence or process, is simply telling you that, could you <em>observe</em> this occurrence (or process) infinitely many times, the fraction of such observations that would yield that <em>specific</em> outcome is <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="p" title="p" class="latex" /> .  Using the age-old coin toss example: tossing the coin is the occurrence or process and recording a Heads or Tails are the two observation. The number 0.5  <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%28P%28%5Ctext%7BTails%7D%29%3D0.5%3DP%28%5Ctext%7BHeads%7D%29%5Cright%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;left(P(&#92;text{Tails})=0.5=P(&#92;text{Heads})&#92;right)" title="&#92;left(P(&#92;text{Tails})=0.5=P(&#92;text{Heads})&#92;right)" class="latex" /> tells a Frequentist that, in the pursuit of infinitely many coin tosses, the ratio of Heads recorded to the number of tosses performed asymptotically approaches 0.5. And that&#8217;s all! The value should not be interpreted as the most likely outcome for the next observation or sample taken from the process (though I&#8217;ve always wondered how a Frequentist would gamble&#8230;).&#8230;</p>]]></description>
