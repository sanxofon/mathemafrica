		<description><![CDATA[<p>Blogging from <a href="http://www.delta2015.co.za/index.php/programme">The Tenth Southern Hemisphere Conference on the Teaching and Learning of Undergraduate Mathematics and Statistics.</a></p>
<p>The zeroth day (before things really kick off with the talks) was both exciting and frustrating, with a group of lecturers and researchers from all corners of the Southern hemisphere, many of whom already knew each other from previous meetings. It seems to be an extremely friendly group, and drinks and snack flowed after registration opened yesterday evening.</p>
<p>The frustration came about because I was rather hoping that on speaking with people it would make choosing which talks to go to easier, but sadly everyone I spoke with seemed to be doing work that they were passionate about, and that was relevant to my own interest in mathematics education. I sit here on day 1 before the talks start none the wiser as to which talks to attend over the coming days, but pretty sure that it&#8217;s going to be an incredibly stimulating week.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Edit: I had a great deal of help for the poster from Andreas Matt, Antonia Mey and Adam Weston.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will head to Port Elizabeth to the <a href="http://www.delta2015.co.za/">Elephant Delta 2015 conference: The Tenth Southern Hemisphere Conference on the Teaching and Learning of Undergraduate Mathematics and Statistics </a>&#8211; quite a mouthful of a title! It looks like it&#8217;s going to be an incredibly full week with a huge amount of new information, new people and new ideas. I am going to attempt to blog as much as I can from the conference. The program is spectacularly full with parallel sessions running through the day. The program can be found <a href="http://www.delta2015.co.za/images/ElephantDeltaProgram_(26%20October).docx">here</a>.</p>
<p>I am already having a tough time deciding which talks to attend, so if you have a look at the program and see something that you would really like me to write about, then please leave a comment and I will do my best to get there and write up what I learn.&#8230;</p>]]></description>
