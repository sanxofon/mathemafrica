		<description><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the first in a series of posts where I will be putting up the sage words of advice of former MAM1000W. Often, these students struggled their way through the course, before making a breakthrough in their study methods. I hope that maybe it will be easier to listen to students who have been through the struggle, than the advice of lecturers who seem to know it all (though I promise you, we do not!).</em></p>
<p><em>Here is the first:</em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>As an Actuarial Science student I was aiming for 70% last year. I clearly remember that at orientation I asked some of the older ActSci students at orientation what they had done when they scored below what they needed to. I was so shocked, and a little scared when the group I asked said they never had. I wasn’t worries at this stage though because I thought I’d done well at maths at school, and I’d do well at maths here.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

<p>The first step of this has been altering the structure of the resource book. The resource book is a PDF which will be sent to all first years taking the course.

		<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Gauss reduction</strong></p>
<p>So far we have seen that we have a way to translate a system of linear equations into a matrix. We can manipulate the matrix in ways which correspond to operations on the equations which keep the important information in the system of equations the same (ie. the solution of the equations before and after the operations is the same). We have seen a couple of examples of when we can read off the solution from the matrix having performed the operations. So far the order with which we perform the operations feels a bit arbitrary, although we know that we would like to get the matrix into reduced row echelon form. There is however a very systematic way of going about this, and the term for the process is called <em>Gauss Reduction</em><strong>.</strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Matrices<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Solving a system of linear equations is not technically difficult: just eliminate the variables in a systematic fashion. When there are only two or three variables, this is easy to manage. But for a bigger system, things can quickly get confusing. We need to develop a systematic method.</p>
<p>The first thing to notice is that the names of the variables don&#8217;t matter. Consider, for example, the two systems</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bcc%7D++x+%2B+y+%26%3D3%5C%5C++2x-y+%26%3D+4++%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;begin{array}{cc}  x + y &#38;=3&#92;&#92;  2x-y &#38;= 4  &#92;end{array} " title="&#92;begin{array}{cc}  x + y &#38;=3&#92;&#92;  2x-y &#38;= 4  &#92;end{array} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bcc%7D++u+%2B+v+%26%3D3%5C%5C++2u-v+%26%3D+4++%5Cend%7Barray%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;begin{array}{cc}  u + v &#38;=3&#92;&#92;  2u-v &#38;= 4  &#92;end{array}" title="&#92;begin{array}{cc}  u + v &#38;=3&#92;&#92;  2u-v &#38;= 4  &#92;end{array}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that if we ignore the names of the variables &#8212; <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="x" title="x" class="latex" /> and <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="y" title="y" class="latex" /> versus <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="u" title="u" class="latex" /> and <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="v" title="v" class="latex" /> &#8212; these two systems are the same. The reason we can tell that they&#8217;re the same is because the {\em coefficients} of the variables are the same and the numbers on the right hand side are the same.

</strong></p>
<p>Solving a system of linear equations is not technically difficult: just eliminate the variables in a systematic fashion. When there are only two or three variables, this is easy to manage. But for a bigger system, things can quickly get confusing. We need to develop a systematic method.</p>
<p>The first thing to notice is that the names of the variables don&#8217;t matter. Consider, for example, the two systems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bcc%7D++x+%2B+y+%26%3D3%5C%5C++2x-y+%26%3D+4++%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;begin{array}{cc}  x + y &amp;=3&#92;&#92;  2x-y &amp;= 4  &#92;end{array} " title="&#92;begin{array}{cc}  x + y &amp;=3&#92;&#92;  2x-y &amp;= 4  &#92;end{array} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bcc%7D++u+%2B+v+%26%3D3%5C%5C++2u-v+%26%3D+4++%5Cend%7Barray%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;begin{array}{cc}  u + v &amp;=3&#92;&#92;  2u-v &amp;= 4  &#92;end{array}" title="&#92;begin{array}{cc}  u + v &amp;=3&#92;&#92;  2u-v &amp;= 4  &#92;end{array}" class="latex" /></p>

<p>In this section we are going to develop a new set of methods to solve a type of problem we are relatively familiar with. We will find a way to translate between methods we know well, but which turn out not to be very efficient, methods which are graphically very intuitive, but not very calculationally useful, and methods which are computationally extremely powerful, but appear rather abstract compared with the other two ways of looking at these problems. These three methods which we will utilise in detail in the coming sections are shown in the following diagram:</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We will discuss mostly three dimensions here, but what we have will be applicable to any number of dimensions (greater than or equal to 1). We want to be able to describe a straight line &#8211; a one dimensional object, infinitely long in both directions. We will see that vectors give us a perfect language with which to do this.</p>
<p>Remember that in three dimensions, a line can be defined by the intersection of two planes as in the intersection of the blue and the green planes defining the red line:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.mathemafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/int.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11605" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.mathemafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/int.png?resize=385%2C315" alt="int" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/www.mathemafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/int.png?resize=300%2C246 300w, http://i1.wp.com/www.mathemafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/int.png?fit=750%2C614 750w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Each plane is specified by a single equation, and thus a line is specified by two equations (one for each plane). Here we will see that sometimes you just need one equation to specify a line, if you are using vectors, and sometimes it will seem that you need three equations, if you are using a parametric equation.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a line, and specify some point on it.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>In the following, I&#8217;m going to miss out quite a few details which I think are very nicely laid out in Stewart. I will try and add a slightly more pedagogical tone to some of it, and some nice diagrams along the way.</p>
<p>So we saw in the last post that we can write the cross product of two vectors, which itself gives a vector, in terms of the determinant of a 3 by 3 array. We can use this to both find a vector perpendicular to two given vectors (unless they are parallel to one another) and also to find the area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors (the area of which is zero if the vectors are parallel to one another).</p>
<p>The second of these is easy enough to do in two dimensions, but in three dimensions that&#8217;s not an easy prospect. Using the cross  (otherwise called the vector) product makes this easy.&#8230;</p>]]></description>
