		<description><![CDATA[<p>The concept of proof by contradiction refers to taking a statement and assuming the <em>opposite</em> is <strong>true</strong>. When assuming the opposite is true we begin to further examine the our &#8216;opposite&#8217; statement and reach to a conclusion which doesn&#8217;t add up or in simple terms is absurd.</p>
<p>Take the case:</p>
<p>Statement: There are <strong>infinite</strong> number of <em>prime numbers</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Using the concept of proof by contradiction, we will assume the opposite is true.</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>If an integer (2) divides an integer (6) we say that 2 divides 6 or 2&#124;6. In a more general sense we can say that if any integer&#160;<em>&#8216;a&#8217;&#160;</em>divides any other integer&#160;<em>&#8216;b&#8217;&#160;</em>then a&#124;b.</p>
<p><strong>Prime numbers: </strong>it is an&#160;integer (n ≥ 2) that has exactly two positive factors (1 and itself).</p>
<p>eg. 2, 3, 5 &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Composite numbers:&#160;</strong>it is an&#160;integer (n ≥ 2)&#160;that has more than two positive factors.</p>
<p>eg. 4, 6, 8 &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:</strong> Every integer n ≥ 2 has a unique (exactly one) prime factorization.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>So, in the last post we proved that <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;sqrt{2}" title="&#92;sqrt{2}" class="latex" /> is irrational, by trying to see what the consequences would be if it were rational. We first said that if it were rational, then we should be able to write it in a simplest form <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7Bq%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;frac{p}{q}" title="&#92;frac{p}{q}" class="latex" /> where p and q had no common factors, and then showed that in fact this was impossible, so our original proposition was indeed true (as trying to prove otherwise gave us a contradiction).<br />
Now we are going to look at another example, which looks very similar, but here our contradiction will be a little different to last time. The fact is that, unlike much of what you would have done at highschool, there isn&#8217;t such a roadmap to how to do things here &#8211; you have to figure out for yourself where the contradiction comes in. In these posts I will point them out for you, but in general, you need to build your intuition about where something looks a bit dodgy and a contradiction is raising its head.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Proof by contradiction may at first seem completely weird! I give you something to prove, and you seem to ignore me and try and prove that what I want you to prove is wrong!</p>
<p>Actually, this isn&#8217;t nearly as strange as it first seems, and it can work in contexts other than mathematics. The idea stems from the fact that a statement is either true, or false (well, if you listen to Gödel, then you have to be a bit careful, but it&#8217;s reasonable enough for now). The process is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>You want to prove that a statement is true.</li>
<li>You say &#8220;what would happen if the statement were actually false?&#8221;</li>
<li>You explore the consequences of it being false.</li>
<li>If you find that it gives you a contradiction (something which you claimed to be true, but which you now see isn&#8217;t true), then you know that in fact the original statement can&#8217;t be false&#8230;so it must be true, and you&#8217;ve proved it.</li></ol>&#8230;]]></description>
