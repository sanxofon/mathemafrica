		<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a continuation of the previous posts, essentially collecting thoughts for first year students. I am asking you, the reader to suggest what might be wrong, or missing from this, and anything else which will be helpful for a new first year who is just arriving at university to study maths…</p>
<p>The following sections in the resource book are about mentors and the whiteboard workshop. They are really quite specific to the course, and more about the details than the philosophy of it, so I am not including them here.</p>
<p>The next section on the other hand is vital, as most students are never given much guidance in how best to revise, and it is one of the most important skills they can gain. I have written my thoughts from my own experience, but I am not trained specifically in education, so I am grateful for any additional thoughts.</p>

<p>Revision is a bit like comedy: Timing is everything!</p></blockquote>&#8230;]]></description>

<p>The next part of the resource book is written by a former first year who very helpfully wrote &#8220;How I achieved over 80% in MAM1000W&#8221;. I am not including this here as I shan&#8217;t be altering what he has written</p>
<p>The next section is entitled &#8220;Tutorials&#8221;, and helps to make the tutorial problem sets and tutorial sessions themselves as useful as possible.</p>
<blockquote><p>The weekly tutorial questions which you will be given to help practice what you&#8217;ve learnt in class are renowned for being time-intensive. This is true, but on top of going to lectures, these are the key element of the course for helping you to really master its content.</p></blockquote>&#8230;]]></description>

<p>The second part of the resource book is a &#8220;Meet the team&#8221; section, which includes photos and a short bio of the convenor (me), the lecturers, and the senior tutors for the course.</p>
<p>The next section is entitled &#8220;Why study mathematics&#8221;, and is in some ways the most controversial/important section in here.</p>
<blockquote><p>For quite a few of you, the immediate answer you may have thought of to this question is not one that will make you happy, but I hope that this section will give you reasons to feel really positive about taking this course.</p>
<p>For some of you, the reason to study maths is because you have to study it as a prerequisite for your course.</p></blockquote>&#8230;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned in the previous post, I am writing a resource book for the first year course that I will be in charge of this year. I want to crowd-source ideas for this a little. By that I mean that I will put up a number of the sections that I&#8217;m writing, and I&#8217;m keen to know, from those who have been through the course whether you feel that there is anything wrong, or missing from this. It is hard to know for someone who has not been on the learning end of a course like this for a long time what makes for the most useful information.</p>
<p>The second reason for doing this is that I think that these thoughts can be used for a wide variety of courses, and so if anyone wants to take these resources and use them in other contexts, then I will be very happy for them to do so.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I am coming to you today with questions. Well, questions based on some of my own ideas&#8230;</p>
<p>This year I will be not only teaching, but entirely in charge of the UCT first year mathematics for scientists courses, known as MAM1000W. I have a number of changes I plan on making, not so much to the syllabus, but to the extra activities associated with the course, in an attempt to make it as rich and deep a learning experience as I can.</p>
<p>The first step of this has been altering the structure of the resource book. The resource book is a PDF which will be sent to all first years taking the course. Historically, it contains a little about the course content, a bit about how your marks will be calculated, a bit about good practice in terms of how to work, and then the second half is filled with tutorial questions.&#8230;</p>]]></description>
