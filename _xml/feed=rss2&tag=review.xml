<div style="width: 394px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/press.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/covers/9780691181622_0.png?resize=384%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">From <a href="https://press.princeton.edu">Princeton University Press.</a></p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m not an expert on the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R programming language</a>, but I have dabbled, which meant that while this book is perhaps aimed at slightly more advanced users (I&#8217;ve used it a half a dozen times for Coursera courses), I had enough to appreciate the value of this really lovely resource.</p>
<p>The book can be seen, I think, in two ways. One of the ways, which is the one which most interests me, is in explaining what it is that makes good data visualization captivating, clear and unambiguous. Interleaved in these ideas of aesthetics are the precisel methods to go about making such visualizations using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html">ggplot package in R</a>.</p>
<p>The other way to look at the book is as a way to really get to grips with the advanced features of the ggplot package, which is taught via interesting examples of data visualization.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

<p>This book straddles a tricky middle ground, given that it introduces topics from scratch and goes into some very specific details of them in a relatively few pages, before jumping onto the next. On starting to read it, I was skeptical of how this could possible work, but by the end of it I believe that I saw the real utility of a book like this. The audience is quite specific, but for them it will be a gem.</p>
<p>The book covers a huge range of ideas related to chance, from the underlying mathematics of probability, to the psychology of decision making, the physics of chaos and quantum mechanics, the problems inherent in induction and inference and much more besides.</p>
<p>The book is taken from a long-running course at Stanford which the authors taught for a number of years, and they have tried to condense down the most important aspects of it to a relatively light book.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

		<title>Finding Fibonacci, by Keith Devlin &#8211; a review</title>

<p>I have a terrible admission to make. I came to this book with a paltry knowledge of Fibonacci (Leonardo of Pisa). The knowledge that I thought that I had was quickly shown in fact to be incorrect, so I was largely starting with a blank slate (Fibonacci did not discover the Fibonacci sequence, nor would he be terribly happy to know that in the popular psyche, this is what he is famous for).</p>
<p>In fact, this book is not really about Fibonacci (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Numbers-Fibonaccis-Arithmetic-Revolution/dp/0802779085">Devlin has another book about him</a>). This is a book about the writing of a book, and about Devlin&#8217;s process of uncovering the history and importance of what Fibonacci had accomplished. It is a book about the research of the history of mathematics, and as such, it is a lovely tale: one of fortuitous moments of discovery, and of frustrations of searching for manuscripts.&#8230;</p>]]></description>

		<title>Group Theory in a Nutshell for Physicists, by Tony Zee &#8211; A review</title>

<p>I studied group theory for the first time around 15 years ago at the beginning of my PhD. There were six of us in the class, and I found it both a magical, as well as a mysterious subject. We had a great lecturer, but the way that the course was set up, and as a course designed for theoretical physicists, where the tools were more important than the construction of the tools, a lot of ideas were left as mysterious boxes where the right answers were guaranteed so long as the algorithm was correctly followed.</p>
<p>Tony Zee is known for his incredible ability to lead the student on a path from little knowledge, to an intuitive understanding of a topic in a seemingly painless process. His books are not necessarily the most technically rigorous (note that this doesn&#8217;t mean that they are wrong, but that the appropriate level of detail is chosen for the new learner such that the overarching ideas aren&#8217;t fogged in unnecessarily complication), but they are, in my opinion some of the best texts for taking a learner from nothing, to a working knowledge with which they can perform calculations that I&#8217;ve ever come across.&#8230;</p>]]></description>
