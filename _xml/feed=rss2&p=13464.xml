		<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much Dr. Shock.
This has helped me realise my mistakes and how important doing the tutorial is, without giving up...and waiting for the memorandum.

Will follow the tips and become a problem solver.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Dr Shock, I think this post shows off some effective ideas that I will try to apply the next time the students I am tutoring feel like they are approaching learning in the wrong way... Always good to have more in your arsenal as a tutor and mentor.]]></description>

The notion of &quot;deep work&quot;, is quite similar to Dr. Shocks suggestions here: http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/11/21/knowledge-workers-are-bad-at-working-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it/

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot Dr. Shock, recently it&#039;s got to a point where I even felt anxiety coz of my phone. I&#039;d study and immediately look at my social media after a few questions, with the same thought process as you have indicated. Then I&#039;d start panicking because by the end of the day I would not have covered as much as I initially wanted to and the test date looms even closer. A few days ago I decided to just stop my social media presence completely and I feel much more productive and confident in my level of knowledge. Thanks for this article, it reinforces my new belief system with some great info and tips]]></description>
